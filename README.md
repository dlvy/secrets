# 🔐 ICP Secrets Vault 🧾

> 👨‍💻 A decentralized, identity-bound, canister-powered secrets manager for the brave new world of Web3 infrastructure devs on the Internet Computer.

---

## 🚀 TL;DR

This is not your average secrets manager, anon.  
We built a 🔐 **Motoko-powered canister** that securely stores your encrypted API keys, tokens, and secret sauce **on-chain**, tied to your **ICP identity**.

🧙‍♂️ No AWS.  
🕳 No third-party vaults.  
🧠 Just **you**, your **principal**, and your **canister**.  

Built in 24hrs, caffeinated, powered by memes, ICP cycles, and the spirit of decentralization. 🤌

## 🧠 Features

- 🧾 Store encrypted secrets (label + value)
- 🔍 View your secrets (only you can see them, bro)
- 🧹 Reset everything (rage wipe mode)
- 🧑‍🚀 Identity-bound via ICP principal
- 💅 Retro “vibe code” aesthetic (optional vaporwave upgrade pending...)

## 🛠️ Local Setup

> You only need: `dfx`, `npm`, and that beautiful ICP energy 💫

1. 🔧 **Install deps**

```bash
npm install
```

2. 🧙‍♂️ **Start local Internet Computer**

```bash
dfx start --background
```

3. 🚢 **Deploy the canister**

```bash
dfx deploy
```

4. 💻 **Run the frontend**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit [`localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) and start vibin’ with your secrets.

## 🧪 API Overview (Motoko Canister)

```motoko
// storeSecret(label: Text, encrypted: Text) → Text
// Stores a secret (requires caller identity)

// getSecrets() → [Secret]
// Returns all secrets for caller

// clearSecrets() → Text
// Deletes all secrets for caller (rage quit)
```

Secrets are stored per `Principal`, so nobody can see yours. Not even us. Especially not us.  
Trust the canister, bro 🤝

---

## 🔐 Security (kinda)

- Secrets are stored **as-is** (for now, encrypt on the frontend 🔐)
- No unauthenticated access — tied to your `msg.caller` (ICP identity)
- Canister state is private unless you expose it yourself, degenerate 🤷‍♂️

> Want real AES crypto or zk-encryption? PRs welcome, fr fr.

## 🧙‍♀️ Future Enhancements (Post-hackathon dreams)

- 🧠 Add proper client-side encryption
- 📦 Bundle secrets as NFTs (why not?)
- 📤 Share secrets across principals (team mode?)
- 🎨 Full vaporwave UI with terminal mode
